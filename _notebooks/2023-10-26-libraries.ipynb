    "- math.sqrt(): This function returns the square root of any number. To use it, the person would input a number into the parentheses, and the output would be the answer. For example, math.sqrt(25) would return 5.0.\n",
    "- math.add(): This function adds 2 or more numbers together. To use it, a person would put the set of numbers into the parentheses seperated by a comma. \n",

    "## Purpose: The random library is used for generating random numbers and performing random operations in Python.\n",

    "## My two favorite functions:\n",
    "- random.randint(a, b): This function generates a random integer between 'a' and 'b'. To use it, the coder would input two numbers seperated by a comma, into the parentheses. The first number would be the minimum of the random number, and the second would be the maximum.  \n",
    "- random.choice(): This function selects a random element from the sequence seq, which can be a list, tuple, or string. It's useful for random selection, e.g., picking a random item from a list.\n",

    "- turtle.forward(): This function moves the turtle forward by a specified distance. It's used for creating various shapes and drawings.\n",
    "- turtle.circle(): This function instructs the turtle to draw a circle with the given radius that will be specified in the parenthesis. You can use it to create circular patterns."
