## <code style="color: #4e804f">☆ Troubleshooting + Errors We Faced ☆</code>
A lot of errors occurred during the process of installing and setting up all our tools. For example, a lot of the commands on the setup instructions didn't work for my mac. I attempted troubleshooting by asking peers, more experienced coders, attending office hours, and researching on my own time. I think a lot of the issue was that I had never used platforms like terminal, and I'm more used to using *HTML, CSS,* and basic *python* I ended up figuring out how to run *python*, *pip*, *brew* and the *make* command, and it taught me how to problem solve without knowing exactly what I'm doing. As I grow and learn as a computer scientist, I will pick up on these troubleshooting skills and e able to solve problems simply by expirementing. 

## <code style="color: #4e804f">☆ Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles ☆</code>
- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
